# NASA API Project
This is a Basic NASA API where you select a Date, Month and Year you should receive a picture of the day.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was something that was pretty nerve wrecking since API is something new and something I've never worked  with but really proud of. This project is really basic where it just pulls information from the NASA server and displays the picture of the day. Using JavaScript in this small project was really straight forward once I read upon few articles and received pointers

## Lessons Learned:

Knowing that there are numerous amounts of APIs makes me want to create more and mess with them since the way they work, submitting a request and retrieving that information back in some sort of picture, piece of text or maybe more is completely interesting. As well I shouldn't really be too nervous with API and continue to work with more to be even more comfortable with creating APIs.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
